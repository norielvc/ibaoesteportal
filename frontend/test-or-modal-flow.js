// Test script to verify OR modal flow
// This simulates the expected behavior:
// 1. Generate OR (without forwarding)
// 2. Show OR preview modal
// 3. Forward request when modal is closed

console.log('OR Modal Flow Test');
console.log('=================');

console.log('1. User clicks "Generate OR & Forward"');
console.log('   - OR is generated via POST /api/official-receipts/generate/:requestId');
console.log('   - Request status remains "Treasury" (not forwarded yet)');
console.log('   - OR file is created and returned');

console.log('2. OR Preview Modal is shown');
console.log('   - Modal displays the generated OR content');
console.log('   - User can print or download the OR');
console.log('   - Request is still in "Treasury" status');

console.log('3. User clicks "Close & Forward"');
console.log('   - Forward request via POST /api/official-receipts/forward/:requestId');
console.log('   - Request status changes to "oic_review"');
console.log('   - Workflow assignments created for releasing team');
console.log('   - Modal closes and data refreshes');

console.log('\nExpected Result:');
console.log('- OR is generated and displayed in modal');
console.log('- Request is only forwarded when user closes the modal');
console.log('- User sees the OR before the request disappears from their assignments');

console.log('\nKey Changes Made:');
console.log('- OR generation API no longer auto-forwards requests');
console.log('- New /forward endpoint handles request forwarding separately');
console.log('- OR preview modal calls forward API when closed');
console.log('- onSuccess callback only called after forwarding is complete');
